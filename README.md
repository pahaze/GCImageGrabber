# GCImageGrabber
A simple program written in Python to give you the image URL of a comic on GoComics.

# Usage
Running is simple, but first you need the following libraries. They're all installable through pip.
```
argparse
requests
```
After all of that, all you need to do is run the app and supply the URL to the comic. \
`./GCImageGrabber.py --url https://gocomics.com/comic/date`

# Plans
Support for saving to a txt file and multiple URL support.

# Legal
If it's needed, if GoComics wants this taken down for whatever reason, I'm not gonna fight it. This app is free, open source, and non-profitable, however, and licensed under GPLv3.
